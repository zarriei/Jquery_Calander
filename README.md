# Jquery_Calander Description

This assignment required us to create a workday planner.
The planner consists of hours in a typical work dy 8 AM - 5 PM and allows the user to plan their day accordingly by
inputing their events, meetings, and action items at their desired time.  This planner is benneficial because it allows the user 
to be more organized and productive as they can optimize their finite amount of time in a typical workday.

My application allows the user to visually distinguish amoung past, present, and future via colors.
Past items in ones schedule are colored gray. Present items are colored blue, and future items are colored green.

Lastly, the calender incorporates a save button for each tiime block in which the user is able to save their input so
that when they close and open or refrsh their calender they will be able to see their saved action items (Done thru local storage utilizing setItem and getItem).

Furthermore, I thought this assignment was actually a lot of fun and I enjoyed researching various ways one can make a calender.  I was pretty impressed by the final product as it is indeed a simple working caldender application.  Workday planners are crucial for any employee or even student.  The bennefits of taking the time to plan our your day allows one to optimize that finite amount of time in a workday and as a result one is able to be much more productive and efficient.
